That means that the police must be visible and accessible to local people. It\u2019s no good having officers hidden away in offices and police cars. It also means that crimes must be investigated properly. When a crime happens people don\u2019t just want a crime number, they want the police to investigate it and catch the people responsible.</p>\n<p>The job of the Commissioner isn\u2019t just to make sure that crimes are investigated, it\u2019s to ensure that crime is reduced in the first place. I want to ensure that we take every opportunity to bring crime figures down, and also to make sure that people no longer fear crime.</p>\n<p>I hope I can bring honesty, experience and integrity to the role. If elected I will use my experience and training to ensure that the police provide a quality service for local people.
