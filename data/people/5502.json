I promised to increase Police Officer numbers, which have risen from a low of 800 to 1120 today. Many crime prevention projects have been started, and I have funded organisations such as Neighbourhood Watch and Speed Watch schemes across the County. Being a victim of crime is often traumatic, and I have spent time and effort building vital partnerships with Victim Support, Refuge, Barnados, Safeline, and many more who support those in need or who are concerned about crime.</p>\n<p>Visibility of the Police is of great importance to us all, and this has grown with more officers out on the ground and a much improved 999 and 101 service. Also, the 4 main Police Stations are now open 7 days a week, enabling face-to-face meetings with Officers and Staff.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to the next 4 years, I intend to reduce crime, Anti-Social behaviour, and re-offending across Warwickshire, with more officers, working with our criminal justice partners, and listening and responding to our residents. I promise to keep working to make the County one of the safest areas to live, work, and visit, and to keep Warwickshire as an independent Force.</p>\n<p>I have lived in Warwickshire all my life and was educated in Rugby, and The Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester. I have served as a District Councillor for 15 years, founded and run my own business for 28 years, and commanded my Army Reserve Regiment.
